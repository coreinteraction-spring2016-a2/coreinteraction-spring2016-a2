# Research

You will choose and research an artist or designer whose work is relevant to interaction design.

You will give a 10 minute presentation to share your research with the class.

Your presentation should include:
- A brief introduction to your chosen artist/designer
- Three examples of their work
- A discussion of three concepts and themes present in their work
- A discussion of three influences and/or related artists/designers

You will also make a simple 1-page website to archive your research and share it with the class. Think about the design of this website and how it relates to the work of the artist or designer you chose.

The website should include:
- The name of the artist/designer
- A ~200 word original text that introduces them and their work
- Links to the work examples you showed in your presentation
- Links to additional references and further reading
