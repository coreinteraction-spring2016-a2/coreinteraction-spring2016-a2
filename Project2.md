# Project 2

*Make a website for an event.*

For this project, you will make an interactive, 1-page website to announce an upcoming event.

You’ll work with the title, date, and description of an event that’s taking place at The New School or in New York (using [Platform for Pedagogy](http://www.platformed.org)).

You will begin by making three interactive prototypes that explore three distinct potential concepts for your website.

You will then choose one prototype to further develop into a finished website. Your website should be able to be viewed on large (desktop) and small (mobile) screens.
