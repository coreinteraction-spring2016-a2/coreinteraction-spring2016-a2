# Project 1

*Make a linear and nonlinear version of a text.*

For this project, you will work with the text of a press release. Press releases are short texts released by organizations to announce new initiatives, events, staff changes, etc.

You will make two interactive versions of this text that convey your interpretation — critical or otherwise — of your chosen text. The first version should create a more linear experience for the reader; the second version should create a more non-linear experience for the reader. With both, your goal is for the reader to not only read the text but to also experience your interpretation of it.

Both versions of the text will be implemented as websites using HTML and CSS. Both may have a single or multiple pages. Both should be able to be viewed on large (desktop) and small (mobile) screens. You should use no more than two typefaces. No images.

Consider:
— How does hyperlinking (internal and external) enhance the meaning of the text?
— How does your interpretation of the text shape the way the information is presented?
— Does the experience change when viewing the page on a larger or smaller surface area? If so, how?
— How does the experience of a linear website compare to the experience of a more non-linear one?
— How does typography reinforce your perspective?
— How does your typography affect the quality of the reading experience? Pay attention to typographic details: special characters, leading, words per line, etc.
